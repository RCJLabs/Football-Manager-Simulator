# Design notes

## Concept

An all-time fantasy football league. Every player entry is a snapshot of one real player at one prime season. You draft a roster against AI GMs, then play a season of simulated games against them. "Manager" by default (set tendencies, watch), "coach" if you want to call plays.

Why one snapshot per player rather than a career: it keeps the pool legible (Brady 2007 is a different card from Brady 2017), avoids modeling aging, and matches how fans argue ("prime Moss vs. prime Deion").

## Cross-era ratings

Raw stats are not comparable across eras (a 1975 passing season looks like a 2020 backup). Ratings therefore describe skills, not stats: how dominant a player was at that skill *relative to his contemporaries*, translated onto one scale (40–99). Anchors: 97–99 is the best ever at that skill; 92–96 All-Pro; 85–91 Pro Bowl; 76–84 solid starter. Stars have real weaknesses (Marino's mobility, a mauling guard's awareness), which is what makes drafting and matchups interesting.

This is editorial. The file is meant to be argued with and edited.

## Roster and lineup

26 slots (see `ROSTER_SLOTS` in `src/data/positions.js`). 24 start; RB2 shares carries (~28%, more if he is the smarter back) and WR4 gets a few targets. There is no fatigue or injury model in v0.1.

## Simulation model (`src/engine/game.js`)

A game is a plain JSON object advanced by `step()`. One step is one event: kickoff, scrimmage play, or PAT. All randomness comes from a mulberry32 RNG whose state lives inside the game object, so a game can be paused, saved, reloaded, and continued identically. Coach mode simply passes `{ off, def, pat }` into `step()`; anything omitted is chosen by the AI.

### Team composites (`ratings.js`)

Offense: pass block (OL pbk + TE), run block, QB attributes, receiver target weights. Defense: pass rush (top two DL heavy, LB share; blitz shifts weight to LB/S), run stop, coverage at three depths (CB/LB/S weighted differently for short/medium/deep), ball skills, tackling, secondary speed.

### Play resolution

Offense chooses one of `run_in, run_out, screen, pass_short, pass_med, pass_deep, pa_pass, fg, punt, kneel, spike`; defense chooses `base, run_stop, blitz, deep`. A small matchup matrix (`MATRIX`) applies modifiers, e.g. blitz vs. screen favors the offense, deep shell vs. deep shot hurts completion, stacked box hurts runs.

Pass: pressure probability from rush vs. protection (logistic, `edge()`); pressure → sack (QB mobility/awareness reduce), scramble, or a hurried throw. Target chosen by role and skill; the primary defender is matched by role (WR1 ↔ CB1, TE ↔ best-coverage LB or S…), so Deion on Rice is a real matchup. Completion probability = base by depth + (QB accuracy/receiver skill − coverage) × slope. Interceptions scale with defense ball skills, QB awareness, pressure, and how badly coverage wins. Yards = air (by depth, QB arm for deep) + run-after-catch (exponential, receiver RAC vs. tackling, breakaway chance from speed vs. secondary speed).

Run: stuff chance from run stop vs. run block (+RB vision); otherwise base gain + blocking edge + break-tackle chance (power/elusiveness vs. tackling) + breakaway chance (speed vs. secondary speed). QB sneaks on 4th-and-1. Fumbles scale with ball security and tackling.

Special teams: FG probability is a logistic in distance with the midpoint set by kicker power and accuracy. Punts: distance from punter power, pooch logic near midfield, placement skill avoids touchbacks and forces fair catches. Kickoffs: touchback rate from kicker power, returns by the fastest non-starter, rare breakaway. Onside kicks when trailing late.

### Game management (`playcall.js`)

Situational pass/run mix from strategy sliders plus down, distance, field position, score and time. Fourth-down chart uses actual kicker make probability and an aggression slider; desperation logic when trailing late. Two-point chart, hurry-up (fewer seconds per snap, more passing), clock-kill when leading, victory formation, spikes, timeouts (offense trailing late; defense trailing while the opponent bleeds clock). Overtime: one 10-minute period in the regular season (both teams possess, then sudden death, ties allowed); playoffs continue until decided.

### Calibration

`npm run calibrate` runs synthetic equal teams (ratings ~85). Targets are roughly modern NFL per-team-per-game: 22–25 points, 340–360 yards, 63–65% completions, ~7.5 yards/attempt, ~4.1 yards/carry, ~1.1 turnovers, ~2.4 sacks, ~84% FG. A 6-point mean rating gap wins ~85%; a 2-point gap ~65%. Constants to reach for when tuning: `baseComp`, `baseInt`, `yacMean`, `stuffP`, the run `base` normals, `pressureP`, and the `edge()` k values (bigger k = flatter response to rating gaps).

## Draft AI (`draft.js`)

Value over replacement: for each position, the replacement level is the overall of the Nth-best available player where N is the league's remaining demand at that position. Pick = highest (overall − replacement) × positional multiplier × GM personality weights (+ era bias for Old School / Analytics) + noise. Kickers and punters are held until the last rounds unless forced. A slot-count guard guarantees every roster fills.

## League (`season.js`)

Double round-robin via the circle method (4/6/8 teams → 6/10/14 games). Standings: win% → point differential → points for. Top 4 (top 2 for a 4-team league) make single-elimination playoffs. User games keep the full log; AI games keep team and player box-score stats only, so a full season fits comfortably in localStorage. Game seeds derive from league seed + week + matchup, so re-simulating a week reproduces it.

## UI

Vanilla ES modules, hash router, one persisted state object (`store.js`). Views re-render from state; the live game view manages its own DOM and autoplay timer. Everything is relative-path so it deploys to a GitHub Pages subpath. Service worker: network-first for HTML, cache-first for assets.

## Known gaps / roadmap

- No penalties, injuries, fatigue, or weather.
- No QB2 / defensive depth; K and P never get hurt.
- Passing distribution is coarse (five depths). Formation/personnel is implied, not modeled.
- Player pool is ~340 entries; comprehensive coverage of "every generation" needs thousands. A CSV importer or community pool file would be the natural next step.
- Multiplayer (hot-seat drafts, exporting a roster to challenge a friend's) is a later phase; the engine is deterministic and serializable to make that possible.
- Real-name licensing: fantasy-stat use of names is well established in the US, but a ratings-driven game is closer to video-game territory. Fine for a hobby project; get advice before monetizing. There is no fictional-name toggle yet.
